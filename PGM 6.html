    Jofra Archer has rapidly become one of the most exciting young fast bowlers in English cricket.
    Born in Barbados to an English father and Bajan mother, the possibility of his inclusion in England's 2019 World Cup
    became subject of much speculation in the run-up to the tournament. Changes to the ECB's qualification
    He impressed with Sussex, as well as in T20 leagues around the world, and made his debut in an ODI against Ireland
    It only took a couple of performances - he picked up 2 for 29 in a T20I against Pakistan
